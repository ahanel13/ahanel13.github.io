# My Journey in Cybersecurity

----

I began studying cyber security in March 2020, while completing my **B.S. in Computer Science from the University of North Texas**. After graduating, I started my first tech job as a Java Software engineer at Citi. After a year, I moved to an internal pentester team.

Since then, I’ve worked as an Application Penetration tester at Citibank for close to two years, becoming the top pentester in NAM based on the number of and the severity of issues found.  

I have acquired the [Burp Suite Certified Practioner](https://portswigger.net/web-security/e/c/403e04ff75c79d49) and [CompTIA Security+](https://www.credly.com/badges/de5e7090-bd2f-4e86-9a89-b793d9234ed9?source=linked_in_profile) certifications and remaine active and HackTheBox.  

I find a lot of satisfaction in finding hidden vulnerabilities and helping others become the best ethical hackers they can be.

I am passionate about secure applications, good coffee, and the outdoors.

As an avid outdoorsman, I enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, camping, mountain biking, and exploring the beauty of our national parks. When I’m not studying for my next certification, you can find me on the trail or planning my next trip!

I was a long-time Texas resident but recently moved to Utah for the outdoor opprotunites, and I currently live with future wife and our 2 cats, April and Tripp.
