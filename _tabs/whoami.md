# My Journey in Cybersecurity

----

I embarked on my cybersecurity journey in March 2020 while pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of North Texas. The pandemic gave me a lot of free to time explore some of my interests. After graduating, I landed my first tech role as a Java Software Engineer at Citi, where I spent a year before transitioning to an internal penetration testing team. (I've come to realize this development role has help me in cybersecurity more than I would have realize. It's good to know how applications work through-in-through.)

Over the next two years, I honed my skills as an Application Penetration Tester at Citibank. During this time, I achieved recognition as the top pentester in the North America region for both years, based on number of high severity issues I uncovered.

I also earned certifications like the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner and CompTIA Security+ while staying active on platforms like HackTheBox to continually refine my skills. (I'm studying for the CPTS and OSCP next be a little more well rounded of a tester.)

I've found somewhat of a passion in discovering hidden vulnerabilities and helping others become exceptional ethical hackers.

Beyond my technical pursuits, an excellent coffee maker, a mediocure woodworker, fly fisherman and a general outdoorsman.

I enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, camping, mountain biking, and exploring the beauty of national parks I have found my self near. When I’m not studying for my next certification, you can often find me tying my own flies or planning my next adventure!

I relocated from Texas to Utah in 2023 to embrace the abundant outdoor opportunities. I work remote and live with my fiancée and our two beloved cats, April and Tripp.
