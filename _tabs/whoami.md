# My Journey in Cybersecurity

----

I began my cybersecurity journey in March 2020 while pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of North Texas. The pandemic gave me a lot of free time to explore my interests, including cybersecurity. After graduation, I landed my first tech role as a Java Software Engineer at Citi, where I spent a year before transitioning to an internal penetration testing team. (I've come to realize this development role has helped me in cybersecurity more than I initially thought. It's good to know how applications work through-and-through.)

Over the next two years, I honed my skills as an Application Penetration Tester at Citibank. During this time, I achieved recognition as the top pentester in the North America region for both years, based on a number of high severity issues I discovered.

I also earned certifications like the Burp Suite Certified Practitioner and CompTIA Security+ while staying active on platforms like HackTheBox to continually refine my skills. I’m currently studying for the CPTS and OSCP next, to be a little more well rounded as a tester.

I’ve found a passion in discovering hidden vulnerabilities and helping others become better ethical hackers.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I make an excellent cup of coffee and am a mediocre woodworker. I'm also a beginner fly fisherman and a general outdoorsman.

I enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, camping, mountain biking, and exploring the beauty of national parks I have found myself near. When I’m not studying for my next certification, you can find me tying flies or planning my next adventure!

I relocated from Texas to Utah in 2023 to embrace the abundant outdoor opportunities. I work from home with my beautiful wife and our beloved cat, April.
