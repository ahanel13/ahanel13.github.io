To help with a HackTheBox machine [MonitorsTwo]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-05-11-Monitors Two Walkthrough %}) I wrote a script that uses the POC from CVE-2022-46169 to create a pseudo shell since I wasnâ€™t able to secure a fully fledge reverse shell. 

This Python script serves as a helper tool to streamline the process of exploiting the CVE-2022-46169 vulnerability. It starts an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests and provides a simple interface for the user to input commands. These commands are then executed on the target server, automating the process of sending crafted payloads to a vulnerable server and observing the server's responses in real-time.

By leveraging this script, a user can automate the process of sending crafted payloads to a vulnerable server and observe the server's responses in real-time.
