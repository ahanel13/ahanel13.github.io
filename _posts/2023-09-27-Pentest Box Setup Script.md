description: I wrote a Bash script that helps set up a pentesting environment on Linux systems that use the apt package manager. This script sets up bash aliases that I like to use and downloads common testing software/projects that Iâ€™ve found helpful.

I realized how long is takes to personalize a pentesting machine when one of my VMs became corrupted. So I wrote a Bash script to set up a Linux-based penetration testing environment by installing various tools commonly used for security assessments and vulnerability testing. It automates the installation of essential software, including Visual Studio Code, penetration testing tools, and their dependencies.

Please note that this script assumes you are running it on a Linux distribution that uses the apt package manager (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian). Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install packages and modify system configurations.

# Download and Running Instructions
## Download the Script
You can download the script directly by clicking here. Alternatively, you can clone this repository to access the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahanel13/PentestBoxSetup.git
cd PentestBoxSetup
```

## Give Execution Permissions
If the script doesn't already have execution permissions, grant them using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x PentestBoxSetup.sh
```

## Run the Script
Execute the script with root privileges (sudo) to ensure it can install packages and modify configurations:

```bash
sudo ./PentestBoxSetup.sh
```

## Follow the Prompts
The script will prompt you for permission to install various packages and dependencies. Enter your password when requested.

## Enjoy Your Penetration Testing Environment
Once the script completes, your penetration testing environment should be set up and ready to use.
